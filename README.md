# FetchRewardsCodingExercise

Hello, my name is Kanoa Matton and this is my Coding Exercise for Fetch Rewards.


This app grabs data using the SeatGeek API endpoint https://api.seatgeek.com/2 to show my ability to make an API call consuming an endpoint for the data I need. 

Goal of the app: 
Create an iOS application that would consume the open-source SeatGeek API and
display events (sports, concerts, etc) in a UITableView. To search an event, a
UISearchBar should be used and it should be placed on the top of the UITableView 
to filter and find certain events.


If there are any questions, my email is kmatton@syr.edu
